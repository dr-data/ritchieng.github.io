## Hello! 
Currently I am leading artificial intelligence with my colleagues in [ensemblecap.ai](https://ensemblecap.ai/), an AI hedge fund based in Singapore comprising [research scientists, engineers, quants, and traders from NVIDIA and JP Morgan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-29/ex-jpmorgan-traders-start-singapore-currency-options-quant-fund). I have built the whole AI tech stack in a production environment with rigorous time-sensitive and fail-safe software testing powering multi-million dollar trades daily. Additionally, I co-run, as portfolio manager, our deep learning systematic portfolio, delivering positive annual returns since 2018.

I am also an [NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute instructor](https://www.facebook.com/nus.nvidia/) leading all deep learning workshops in NUS, Singapore and conducting workshops across Southeast Asia.

My passion for enabling anyone to leverage on deep learning has led to the creation of [Deep Learning Wizard](https://www.deeplearningwizard.com/) where I have taught and still continue to teach more than 2000 students in over 60 countries around the world. The course is recognized by [Soumith Chintala](https://pytorch.org/2018/01/19/a-year-in.html), Facebook AI Research, and [Alfredo Canziani](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6407592585275142144), Post-Doctoral Associate under Yann Lecun, as the first comprehensive PyTorch Video Tutorial. 

I have taught [Deep Learning Foundations](https://github.com/Atcold/pytorch-Deep-Learning-Minicourse) with Alfredo Canziani at Rwanda, Africa for the African Masters in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) in 2018 supported by Google and Facebook.

In my free time, I'm into applied deep learning research on AI for Social Good with researchers in NUS, Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA), New York University (NYU), and African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS). I am a research scholar in [NExT (NUS)](http://www.nextcenter.org/) and a PYI Fellow.

I was previously conducting research in meta-learning for hyperparameter optimization for deep learning algorithms in NExT Search Centre that is jointly setup between National University of Singapore (NUS), Tsinghua University and University of Southampton led by co-directors [Prof Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) (KITHCT Chair Professor at the School of Computing), [Prof Sun Maosong](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/4623/2010/20101224193416561782037/20101224193416561782037_.html) (Dean of Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University), and [Prof Dame Wendy Hall](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/wh) (Director of the Web Science Institute, University of Southampton).

I graduated from NUS where I was an NUS Global Merit Scholar, Chua Thian Poh Community Leadership Programme Fellow, Philip Yeo Innovation Associate, and NUS Enterprise I&E Praticum Award recipient. I was awarded the [IT Youth Leader of the Year Award](https://www.scs.org.sg/it-leader-awards/winners-by-year.php?year=2019) in 2019.

## Credits
I would like to thank all my readers for their encouraging participation on this Github page. I would also like to thank Github Pages for serving this [respository](https://github.com/ritchieng/ritchieng.github.io) of notes for free.

I would like to give full credit to the respective authors for their free courses and materials online like Andrew Ng, [Data School](https://www.dataschool.io/about/) and Udemy where my notes are from them. These personal notes are meant for my personal review but I have open-sourced my repository of personal notes as a lot of people found it useful.

Take note that I'm currently concentrating entirely on building materials for Deep Learning with PyTorch from mastering deep learning, to deploying deep learning algorithms in production, and to to solve many problems through [Deep Learning Wizard](https://www.deeplearningwizard.com/).
